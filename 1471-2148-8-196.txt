For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	In contrast the small additions/deletions in introns will not affect the nature of the protein product but may affect its expression.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	It is important to note that in spite of this segment switching positions of cysteine residues are conserved thereby maintaining similar disulfide pairing folding architecture and the overall three-finger fold of the mature protein.	0

For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	In viperid toxin genes however the insertions of segments do not occur at the intron-exon boundaries so the mechanism of insertions/deletions or switching of segments does not occur due to errors in splicing.	0

For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Recombination: Distinct genes encoding isoforms of proteins are also generated through recombination of two related/unrelated genes .	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	In general the segments involved in such recombination events are fairly large (700 to 2500 bp) and the segments that are exchanged in exons of 3FTxs are probably much too small.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Therefore canonical recombination may not be involved in these exchange events.	0

Independent recruitment events: Venom protein genes are thought to be recruited to the venom gland genome by gene duplication of a normal physiologically important gene and recruitment of the duplicated gene for expression in the venom gland .	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	It is possible but not probable that each of these isoforms has an independent origin and their ancestral three-finger toxin genes were recruited at different times.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	High similarity across numerous 3FTx genes in exon I and introns I and II supports instead a single recruitment and lineage of these genes and not multiple recruitment events.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	In the unlikely events of independent recruitments introns will have to undergo convergent evolution to explain the high similarity while the exons will be undergoing divergent evolution.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Therefore segment switching results in divergence of functional regions of exons (see below) while maintaining the basic fold rather than convergence upon a single scaffold motif during independent recruitment.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Although the mechanism of the exchange of segments in exons is unknown it is apparent that these events play important roles in the evolution of these toxins in addition to the role that accelerated point mutations in the exons plays in toxin evolution .	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	These point mutations appear to alter the interaction surfaces of toxins .	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.

For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	They may (a) enhance the affinity to a specific receptor or ion channel; (b) change the specificity to another closely related receptor or ion channel; and (c) change the species specificity of the toxin to a particular receptor.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	In contrast accelerated exchange of larger segments drastically changes parts of the interacting loops or toxin surface.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Therefore these exchanges of segments may help in switching the molecular targets of toxins and hence affecting their pharmacological properties.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	We propose that accelerated segment switch in exons to alter targeting (ASSET) is a phenomenon which plays an important role in "remodeling" a toxin toward a different and novel receptor target (see below).	0

For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	This drastic difference in the charge residues on the surface is due to the exchange of segments (see Additional file ) but retention of the similar molecular fold.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Such a change in the charged residues might play an important role in switching the molecular targets.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Since most of the functional sites are located on these ?-sheeted loops (for a review see ) it is logical to propose that all of these novel viperid toxins have distinct pharmacological properties.	0
For example, we have recently used transcriptomic analysis to show the presence of three-finger toxins (3FTxs) in viperid venom.	Therefore ASSET phenomena affect the molecular surfaces of three-finger toxins significantly and alter their molecular targets playing a crucial role in the evolution of the three-finger toxins.	0
