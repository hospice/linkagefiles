Second and more importantly highly expressed genes which are under selection for translational efficiency use only a small subset of the cognate codons for a particular amino acid (this incidentally is exploited in the construction of the CAI) and because this subset is often the same even in phylogenetically remote organisms Â– for example for those amino acids encoded by nnU and nnC (e.g. phenylalanine or cysteine) nnC is almost universally preferred Â– the silent substitution rate is reduced.	0
