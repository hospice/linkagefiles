No such information was found for tomato but it may be concluded that also in tomato a single plant will have multiple initial cells in the seed before the EMS-treatment is applied and therefore will produce multiple independent mutations in its offspring.	0
The HRM assay has successfully been used to detect point mutations in ethyl methanesulfonate-mutated plant populations.	Also it is probable that offspring arising from a single fruit will have a high probability of carrying the same mutation as apparently generally in plants only 2-3 initial cells form the gametes in an inflorescence.	0

The HRM assay has successfully been used to detect point mutations in ethyl methanesulfonate-mutated plant populations.	With background mutations it is easy to explain both results 1) that the same mutant sequences were found in M2 and M3-families in 2 out of 8 mutations and 2) the fact that homozygous mutants were found (3 out of 19 different mutations were homozygous for the M2 and M3-family analysis with ProDH).	0
