For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Consistent with this notion treatment with proteasome inhibitors largely restored the levels of multiple F-box proteins and dominant-negative Cul1 prevented loss of cyclin F.	5

For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Concomitant with loss of Csn5 we observed significant decreases in the steady-state protein levels of Skp2 cyclin F Fbw7 Fbx4 and Fbx7 (Figure 2A).	5
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Despite the significant drop in protein levels there was little change in mRNA levels suggesting that for 4 of the 5 F-box proteins examined (Fbx4 being the exception) the loss of protein was due to reduced translation or increased degradation (Figure 2B).	3
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	The protein levels of Fbx4 could not be rescued by overexpression of wild-type mouse CSN5 suggesting that loss of Fbx4 arose from a promiscuous effect of the CSN5-directed siRNA and was not due to Csn5 knockdown (data not shown) Therefore the reduction in Skp2 and cyclin F levels in Csn5-depleted cells is caused by the loss of CSN isopeptidase activity.	2
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.

For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Loss of Csn5 causes both loss of deneddylation activity and loss of CRL-associated deubiquitination activity mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp12 .	5
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Ubiquitination and turnover of CRL substrate receptor proteins is suppressed by Ubp12 and thus it is possible that the loss of F-box proteins that we observed in Csn5-depleted cells was due to loss of either deneddylation by Csn5 and/or F-box protein deubiquitination by Ubp12.	3
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	In Csn5-depleted cells the inactivation process is not initiated and therefore the F-box protein remains constitutively associated with a highly active neddylated cullin-RING catalytic core resulting in a high rate of F-box protein ubiquitination and degradation.	3
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Given the substantial reduction in the steady-state levels of multiple F-box proteins upon depletion of Csn5 it is surprising that depleted cells continued to proliferate with normal cell cycle kinetics and did not exhibit a dramatic phenotype.	2

For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	One partial answer to both of these questions is that F-box and other substrate receptors are often unstable proteins and it is thought that they are targeted for degradation in part by 'autoubiquitination' within SCF-E2 complexes .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.

For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Thus we propose that loss of CSN-dependent deneddylation is sufficient to bring about a reduction of steady-state F-box protein levels in human cells.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	The exact mechanism by which the substrate adaptors are turned over in Csn5-depleted cells is unknown.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	However the stimulatory effect of neddylation on SCF activity in vitro  and the restoration of cyclin F levels by dominant-negative Cul1 in Csn5-depleted cells suggests an autocatalytic mechanism wherein an F-box protein is ubiquitinated by the neddylated Cul1-Hrt1 catalytic module present in the same SCF complex.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	We propose that once an SCF ubiquitin ligase exhausts its pool of available substrate deneddylation of the Cul1 subunit by CSN brings about disassembly of the complex with the end result being that the Skp1-F-box heterodimer is released and Cul1-Hrt1 are sequestered into an inactive assemblage with CAND1.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Interestingly whereas most F-box proteins that we examined (e.g. cyclin F) exhibited a significant decline in levels upon depletion of Csn5 others (?-TrCP Emi1) were not affected (G.A.C. unpublished data).	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	We do not understand the basis for this difference but it is unlikely to reflect whether a given F-box protein is turned over in normal cells because ?-TrCP levels were not reduced in Csn5-depleted cells even though transfected ?-TrCP is turned over with a reasonably brisk half-life of ~120 minutes .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Clearly more work is needed to determine why accumulation of only some F-box proteins depends upon CSN.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	For example overexpression of cyclin E  or deletion of Fbw7  causes chromosomal instability but we were unable to detect any measurable defect in chromosome status in Csn5-depleted cells (data not shown).	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	Given that depletion of Csn5 can affect so many different F-box proteins and presumably SOCS/BC box and BTB domain proteins as well it is possible that opposing pathways were perturbed in such a way as to prevent the onset of chromosome instability.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	A similarly mild growth effect of depleting Csn5 was seen in a previous study of the normal diploid human fiboroblast BJ1 cell line .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	As we have noted previously the function of Csn5 may be more critical in a multicellular context or in the face of differentiation signals that evoke a major change in the repertoire of cellular proteins .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	While this manuscript was in preparation it was reported that loss of function mutations in CSN components in S. pombe and Neurospora renders the substrate-recruiting subunits of both Cul1 and Cul3-based CRL complexes unstable resulting in accumulation of their respective targets .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	In addition deneddylation of cullins mediated by CSN is required for the maintenance of cullin protein levels in Drosophila and for Cul1 stability in Neurospora .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	In our original studies in S. pombe  we observed normal levels of Cul1 in a csn1? mutant and this result has been confirmed and extended to other cullins in S. pombe  as well as Arabidopsis thaliana .	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	The results reported here indicate that accumulation of human cullins does not depend on CSN-dependent deneddylation.	0
For example, the conditional knockdown of CSN5 expression in HEK293 cells using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system led to the degradation of F-box proteins accompanied with reduced CRL activity.	It is unclear why human fission yeast and Arabidopsis cullins behave differently from those of Drosophila and Neurospora.	0
