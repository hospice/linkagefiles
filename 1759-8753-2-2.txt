Our previous data showed that the generation of ORFeus-Mm with optimized codons which were presumably free of sequences that might hamper transcription resulted in a highly active element with levels of retrotransposition that were as much as 200-fold higher than the native element .	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	These were shown to be in part due to higher levels of mouse L1 transcripts  and presumably correspondingly higher levels of protein products.	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	In our recoding process most or all of these signals were removed and this probably contributed to the increased abundance of full-length L1 RNA (Figure 2 Figure 3).	0

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	One obvious reason that ORFeus-Hs did not increase retrotransposition frequency by 200 times is that the native mouse L1 element (L1spa) has much lower activity than the native human L1RP element .	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	This could represent an upper limit of L1 retrotransposition that can be readily tolerated by tissue-culture cells and/or a rate-limiting step(s) during the process of retrotransposition.	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	Elevated levels of L1 RNA/protein and shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm may have a strong effect on the cell perhaps overloading its full capacity to process L1-RNP retrotransposition intermediates .	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	It is formally possible that codon optimization changes made in ORFeus corrected a mutation(s) in a cis element(s) that hampers retrotransposition efficiency of native L1 but results from both the study of Han et al.  on the mouse element and the present study on the human element show that L1 activity increases progressively as larger proportions of the native sequence are recoded consistent with the reported elongation defect.	0

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	This suggests that different promoters somehow produce RNAs that are of different 'quality'.	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	One difference in quality is the structure of the RNA 5' end; the CMV promoter fragment also contains the 51 bp viral 5' UTR upstream of the L1 ORF1 AUG motif whereas the native L1 promoter introduces the native 907 bp L1 5' UTR in its place.	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	This suggests that when comparing native versus synthetic RNA sequences the latter either interferes with translational efficiency decreases stability of the encoded protein or both.	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	Because codon optimization is predicted to increase translational efficiency it is surprising that protein levels actually decreased relative to RNA template abundance.	0

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.	Alternatively if the interaction between the RNA and the protein to form RNP intermediates is abrogated in the fully or mostly synthetic elements any ORF1 protein that does not get incorporated into RNPs may become very unstable potentially explaining the RNA-protein discrepancy observed here.	0
All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.

All transposition assays were performed using   ORFeus  -Hs that encodes wild type ORF1 and ORF2 proteins but transposes at a 2~3 fold higher frequency (~2%) than the corresponding native human L1.
